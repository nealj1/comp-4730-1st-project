Choose a dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu) with at least 5000 instances and 20 attributes for classification or regression.
Compare how the different approaches seen in class perform on this dataset to predict accurately the classes or the values of the unlabeled data. You should determine what are the best hyper-parameters for each approach you are using.

# Virtual Environment Setup

This guide will help you set up a Python virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies and isolate them from your system-wide Python installation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone or Download the Project Repository
git clone <repository-url>

# 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
cd project-directory

# 3. Create a Virtual Environment (replace <env-name> with your preferred name)
python -m venv <env-name>

# 4. Activate the Virtual Environment (Windows)
.\<env-name>\Scripts\activate

# 4. Activate the Virtual Environment (macOS and Linux)
source <env-name>/bin/activate

# 5. Install Project Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 6. Deactivate the Virtual Environment
deactivate
